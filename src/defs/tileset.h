/**
 * A singleton class which is responsible for the tileset that is loaded.
 *
 * Essentially, there are two ways of getting copies of tileset tiles through
 * this class:
 *
 * 1. Theoretically slower, but easier to remember: Use the "get" method, which
 *    performs the "singleton check".
 *
 *    Tileset::get("BLOCK_WALL");
 *
 * 2. Faster, but more of a pain - Get a pointer to the tileset for use in
 *    highly-repetitive operations:
 *
 *    std::unordered_map<std::string, Tile>* ts_pointer = &Tileset::instance()->get_tileset();
 *    for(big ol' loop) {
 *        do_something_with((*ts_pointer)["BLOCK_WALL"]);
 *    }
 *
 *    Remember, this is a pointer to the global tileset. With great power comes
 *    great responsibility. Never, ever use it as an lvalue.
