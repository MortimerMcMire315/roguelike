 * you want, and then put the condition at the beginning of the first node,
 * so that if it fails you move to the second.  However, if the node
 * were to fail for another reason (like, for instance, a character
 * being unable to move), then you would move onto the second one anyway.
 * This is a problem, so I made a branching conditional.  It will execute
 * the first node if the condition returns success, otherwise it will
