/*
Explanation of how the screen works: There is a chunk map, which holds all of
the chunks.  We need a way to go from chunk->screen.  However, since we always
want the character to be centered, there will be times when the screen consists
of half of one chunk and half of another.

Let's say that this is an array of chunks:

111222333 
111222333 
111222333

and the screen is 3x3, to give us a view of:

222 
2X2 
223

with X being the character.  If the character moves left, then we get:

122 
1X2 
122

So, there is a buffer, which essentially holds all of the surrounding chunks.
A buffer might look like:

123 
456 
789

Where each number is a different chunk.  But, we only want part of this to get
written to the screen.  So, we have a canvas, which is the size of the screen
taken from the buffer with the character at the center.

                        This part is a bit confusing.  What I need is to write
                        the contents of the chunkt to the appropriate place in
                        the buffer.  A and B represent the Y and X of
                        individual tiles.  So, for each chunk, the X and Y are
                        written to the buffer.  The chunks that we're iterating
                        through are essentially a 3x3 array.  Each chunk needs
                        to start being written at the appropriate location
                        (e.g. the second chunk needs to start where the first
                        one left off...), which is where the x and y variables
                        come in.  Starting at 0, the x and y are multiplied by
                        the width/height of the chunk, which is added to a and
                        b to get where the tile from the chunk corresponding to
                        a and b should be written to the buffer.  For example:
                        The first chunk should start writing tiles to the
                        buffer at 0,0.  The second chunk should start writing
                        tiles at 0 + CHUNK_WIDTH, and the third tile should
                        start writing at 0 + (CHUNK_WIDTH * 2).
