/**
 * The class that holds settlements. This can be as small as a
 * 1 chunk wide village, or as large as a half-continent spanning
 * city.  While it does not define the rules for building the
 * chunks (those are in chunk.cpp), it does define the rules
 * for how the settlement gets broken up into districts, e.g.
 * market, residential, nobility, etc.
 *
 
 * Big Cities = 12,000-100,000 people, rarely exceeding 50,000.
 * Cities = 8,000-12,000 people.
 * Towns = 1,000-8,000 people.
 * Villages = 20-1,000 people.
 * Isolated dwellings = >20 people.
 * These will be generated in order of size to fill the population of a nation.  
 * The more rural settlements will make up the majority of the population 
 * (villages and isolated settlements), with ~3% of the population existing
 * in urbanized locations.
