/**
 * Generates dungeons in a "procedurally-blind" manner.
 *
 * The method for this dungeon generation technique is:
 *
 * 1. Create a viable "first" dungeon room.
 * 2. Tunnel out from that room in a number of paths.
 * 3. At the end of the last path that was created, try to create another room.
 * 4. Repeat this until one of two conditions is met:
 *      a. The room limit is reached
 *      b. There is no viable room space at the end of the path.
 * 5. If the resulting dungeon does not have very many rooms, scrap it and start
 * over. This currently happens <25% of the time.
